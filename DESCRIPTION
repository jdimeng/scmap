Description: Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) is widely used to
        investigate the composition of complex tissues since the
        technology allows researchers to define cell-types using
        unsupervised clustering of the transcriptome. However, due to
        differences in experimental methods and computational analyses,
        it is often challenging to directly compare the cells
        identified in two different experiments. scmap is a method for
        projecting cells from a scRNA-seq experiment on to the
        cell-types identified in a different experiment.
